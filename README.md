# ðŸ“˜ Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python

This assignment is part of **Module 4** and focuses on using functions and built-in Python modules.  
It contains two Python programs: one for calculating the factorial of a number using a custom function, and another that performs mathematical operations using the `math` module.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### âœ… Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
- Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as input.
- Calculates its factorial using either a loop or recursion.
- Returns the result.
- Calls the function with a sample input and prints the output.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### âœ… Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Uses the `math` module to calculate:
  - The square root of the number
  - The natural logarithm (base e)
  - The sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays all calculated values.
